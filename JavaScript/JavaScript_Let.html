<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var  x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

var a = "John Doe";

var a = 0;

//it will be declared even the first var and the second var is different type variables
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a;

//Comparation between let and var when redeclaring variables

let y = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
let y = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here y is 10
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y;

//let z = "John Doe";

//let z = 0;

//It'll not be redeclared
//document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = z;

    What is Good?
let and const have block scope.
let and const can not be redeclared.
let and const must be declared before use.
let and const does not bind to this.
let and const are not hoisted.
    What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.
var is hoisted.
var binds to this.
